Rayman 2 for Archipelago
---

A mod for Rayman 2 built on the [Twofold](https://github.com/spitfirex86/Twofold) mod loader to add support to Rayman 2 for using it with the [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago) tool.

Absolutely gigantic credit goes to Spitfire_x86 for their incredible work on making the mod loader and so many useful mods without which this would be absolutely impossible.

This work is based on [R2DbgScr](https://github.com/spitfirex86/R2DbgScr) and [R2Console](https://github.com/spitfirex86/R2Console) by Spitfire_x86. Parts derived from these projects are under the copyright of Spitfire_x86.
